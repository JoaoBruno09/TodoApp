# ToDo App

Welcome to my ToDo App developed in Ionic 5 ! This app was developed after the Ionic5 course. It is an App where it is possible to create a list of things to do and mark them as done, edit them or even delete them. Through this development, I gained valuable skills in building cross-platform mobile applications using Ionic framework version 5.
